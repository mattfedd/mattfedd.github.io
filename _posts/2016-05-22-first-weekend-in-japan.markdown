Nothing too exciting here, just some pictures and commentary. 

On Saturday we walked around a bit and explored the supermarket. Highlights: they played classical music over the speakers, there was way more fresh fish than I expected, and there was a neat deli section with cheap prepared meals (including whole sushi platters!). I didn't take any pictures there, I was too focused on buying food. 

I bought some salmon, chicken, onions, tomatoes, eggs, carrots, broccoli, soy sauce, noodles, rice, plastic containers, and this Japanese brand of chocolate called Crunky. I just had to get some of that crunky chocolate. It has little bits of almond and what seems like rice crispies in it, it's pretty good!

[My first home cooked meal!](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/26560744784_2e3c972821_z.jpg) Rice, onions, salmon. Breakfast the next day was the same thing plus eggs and tomatoes. 

Otherwise here's some pictures from around town:

This was for some promotion in KFC (which is quite popular in Japan, by the way).

Absolutely everywhere. I wouldn't be surprised if they were in super rural towns and national parks.

The bottom left says "Matsudo-shi", which means Matsudo City, and the right says "osui" which is just "sewage".
