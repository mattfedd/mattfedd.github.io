Because there are so many pictures, I consolidated them all at the bottom of this post. 

# Akihabara

Last week we went to Akihabara, which is a section of Tokyo that is famous for having a plethora of electronics shops as well as many cartoon-themed entertainment areas. Unfortunately I didn't take too many pictures while we were there, but I plan to visit again before the summer ends. The interesting aspects Akihabara has to offer include 1) cheaper electronics shops, 2) anime shops and arcade parlors, and 3) [maid cafes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maid_caf%C3%A9). I'm definitely going to explore #1 and #2 more in the future, but I don't think I'm too interested in #3. 

# Asakusa

Asakusa is a district in Tokyo that is famous for its many small shops, older architecture, and a large Buddhist temple, _Senso-ji_. As such it is a huge tourist magnet. We went with some coworkers who knew the area, so that helped as we were navigating around, but it didn't change the fact that it was outrageously crowded. 

While we were in Asakusa, we ate at a [Monjayaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monjayaki) restaurant. In this type of restaurant, you cook your own pancake-like dish with all sorts of different savory fillings. The base of the pancake is cabbage and egg, and fillings such as meat, seafood, vegetables, cheese, and spices are added. A griddle is built into the table where customers cook and eat their own Monjya pancake. 

Afterward, we ate [anmitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anmitsu), which is an agar-based dessert. It was served with red beans, regular mochi, fruit, and ice cream. It was okay... I'd call it an acquired taste. 

# Skytree

After the _anmitsu_ we headed over to the Tokyo Skytree, which was a 10 minute walk away from Asakusa. The skytree is the tallest building in Japan, and supposedly offers a great view of Tokyo. However, we didn't go up to the top: it was 3000 yen to get up there, it was windy so the elevators experienced delays, and it was cloudy so we didn't expect much from the view. The lower levels had a bunch of shops and restaurants that we explored, though. 

One of the restaurants was called the World Beer Museum, and had an astounding selection of beer. Their main focus was beer from Germany, Belgium, America, Czech Republic, and Britain, but they had selections from all over the world. 

We went back to Matsudo for dinner where I had [tsukemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsukemen), a type of ramen. Instead of being an integrated soup like normal ramen, this separated the broth from the noodles. You have to dip the noodles in a broth and then slurp it up. The noodles are cold, but the broth is boiling, so everything evens out as you eat. 

# Next time

I'll probably post something new next Friday/Saturday, after the work week is done. On Friday, some folks from my department are taking me for a "welcome party". I don't know what that means, but I assume it will be at a restaurant of some sort. No plans for the weekend yet, but the following weekend I will be at the Mynavi International Job Fair in Tokyo helping Mabuchi recruit new hires. 

And now for the pictures!
