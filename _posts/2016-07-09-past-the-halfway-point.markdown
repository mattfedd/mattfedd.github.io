I officially have 3 weeks left in Japan! Time always passes so quickly...it doesn't feel like it's been 7 weeks. 

Upcoming adventures:

- going to Kamakura

- hiking

- viewing fireworks 

- visiting the Studio Ghibli museum

- eating at a Michelin-starred ramen restaurant, [Tsuta](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066460-d7493901-Reviews-Tsuta-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html)

- and more

Now let's hope that I have enough time to write about all those things afterward! 

## Hondo-ji

A few weeks ago I visited _Hondo-ji_, which is a temple in the nearby city Matsudo. Its nickname is _ajisaidera_, which means "hydrangea temple", referencing the ridiculous amount of hydrangeas that grow there during the summer. 

It was a nice departure from the busy city life of Tokyo.

In front of this statue is the Japanese offering box, where people can throw 5-yen coins before praying. The word for 5 yen sounds like "respectful relationship" or "destiny" in Japanese, and from this it's believed to help build a connection with the deity of the shrine when you pray. The word for 50-yen coin sounds like "5 layers", so sometimes people throw in a 50-yen coin with the hopes of getting 5 times the effect. But I feel like that's inefficient compared to just using more 5-yen coins. Maybe I'm missing something. 

Both the 5-yen and the 50-yen coins have a hole in the center, so they're usually tied to things with a little string to make good luck charms. Speaking of good luck charms, don't forget the humble Kit-Kat: Japanese students give each other Kit-Kats for good luck when they're taking their entrance exams. This is because the Japanese word for Kit-Kat, _kitto katto_, sounds like _kitto katsu_, or "surely you will win".

## Other adventures

On July 2, I attended a Japan Illini Club reunion in Tokyo. It consisted of native Japanese who had studied at the U of I, current students who had just won a scholarship to study abroad in Illinois, and American UIUC alumni who were currently working in Japan. As a bonus, the directors of the UIUC Japan House attended as well. No pictures yet, unfortunately. 

The next day, I headed to the south side of Chiba prefecture for an seaside BBQ that a coworker had organized. Unfortunately the beach in that part of Chiba is rocky and inaccessible, so we settled for the grassy hills nearby. I even had a picture taken of me! How rare...
