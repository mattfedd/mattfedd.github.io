This is my personal webpage, where I'll try to post things from time to time. Nothing too fancy.

<br /><br />

10/11/2020: Welcome to the future. Time to put some love into this website again, starting with a
cleaner theme.

<br /><br />

9/19/2016: I updated my resume, and changed the format of the blog a little bit. In the future I'll
try adding some tags for categorizing/searching through posts.

<br /><br />
<ul>
  <li class="nav-item"><a href="{{ site.github.repo }}/about">About</a></li>
  <li class="nav-item"><a href="{{ site.github.repo }}/archive">All posts</a></li>
  <li class="nav-item"><a href="{{ site.github.repo }}/blog">Latest</a></li>
</ul>
