Personal website v2.0

Heavily reliant on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole)

## Developing

Make sure Jekyll is installed (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/). I used WSL.

Navigate to the top level folder and run `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl /` to run on localhost:4000. Add `-P <port_num>` to specify a port number other than 4000.

## TODOs

- [ ] Include convenient links in header (archive, about, home, etc)
- [ ] Add tags to posts, add some way to filter by tags
- [ ] Change favicon
