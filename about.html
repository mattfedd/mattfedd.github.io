<h1>About me</h1>

My name is Matthew Feddersen. I grew up near Berkeley, California and am currently a student at the University oif Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). While I studied Computer Engineering for my undergraduate degree, I'm now working towards a Masters in Electrical Engineering specializing in electric machines and drives.

<h3>Work/Research</h3>

I'm currently working in the Haran group at UIUC, which focuses on new electric motors/generators, motor drives, and various other power electronics research topics.

Most of my work has been towards designing a superconducting electric motor for eventual use in turboelectric aircraft.

<h3>Things I enjoy</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>Learning languages</i>. I grew up speaking English and Czech, then I took Spanish classses through high school, French in college, and now I'm learning Japanese. Eventually I'd like to learn Mandarin and maybe German.</li><br />
<li><i>Piano and classical music</i>. Let's be honest, I'm not good enough at the piano these days to play anything amazingly. And I haven't played seriously in a long time. Regardless, I love listening to new pieces and then attempting to play them. The last one I learned really well was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y2mS0xxdsc">Rachmaninoff's Prelude in G Sharp Minor</a>. Otherwise I listen/play at all the basics (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Schubert, Rachmaninoff, Debussey) and then some (Medtner, Godowsky, Bolcom, Say, Glinka, Cui). By the way, I am always trying to find my way to any concerts by Marc Andre Hamelin, Martha Argerich, Evgeny Kissen, or Krystian Zimerman. </li><br />
<li><i>Martial Arts</i>. I practiced Okinawan/Shorin Ryu karate for about 8 years with a little bit of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu on the side, stopping once I graduated high school and moved to Illinois. If I find the time and the right dojo I'd love to keep training. I've forgotten a lot of the forms and techniques, but I still think it would be super fun to start again.</li><br />
<li><i>Programming</i>. I have a lot of small unfinished games that I tried to program, and I still like tinkering around in my spare time. C, Python, Java, whatever works. </li><br />
<li><i>Electric Cars</i>. I joined the Formula Electric team at UIUC during my junior year, and became electrical captain the year after. Now I'm a graduate student advisor for the team. Most of my work has gone into integrating the motor, motor controller, and batteries with the rest of the car, and I love thinking up new ways to improve existing designs on the vehicle. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IlliniFormulaElectric/videos/975959875827442/">Here's a video</a> of our most recent car at Engineering Open House, March 2016. </li><br />
<li><i>Reading</i>. Lots of science fiction, fantasy, and mystery. Too many favorites to list.</li><br />
<li><i>Movies</i>. I'm a sucker for Donnie Yen kung fu movies these days. Otherwise, dark and broody films, animated films, and sometimes super artsy pretentious films (in moderation). Again, too many favorites to list.</li><br />
<li><i>Travel and the outdoors</i>. Camping, travelling, hiking, eating, taking cool pictures... enough said.</li><br />
