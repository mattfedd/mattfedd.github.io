title: About
---

I'm currently a software engineer at SteelSeries. Previously I worked at [Zunum Aero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zunum_Aero), an electric aviation startup that wasn't able to take off (ho ho ho). Their [website](https://zunum.aero/) is still up as of Oct 2020.

In college I studied computer engineering then stayed another 2 years to do my masters in Electrical Engineering. During that time I worked on superconducting motor research. Some of my best memories are from teaching the Electric Machines class (ECE 431) during my last semester. 

## Things I enjoy

- Learning foreign languages
- Piano and classical music
- Reading, mostly sci-fi and fantasy books
- Recently I forced myself to start running regularly. I "enjoy" it :)
